1.x.x (unreleased)
    * Added a new "Group by application" view.
    * It's no longer necessary to manually keep ADB Debugging enabled.
    * If signed with the system certificate, use Android's official APIs
      rather than root access. This won't be relevant for most users, but
      is useful when compiling a custom Android.
    * Easier scrolling via a draggable thumb, as known from the Contacts
      app.
    * Russian translation (Andrew Ivanchenko).

1.6.2 (2010-11-26)
    * Fixed: Occasionally, apps could not be disabled, and an "you might
      not have root" messages was accidentally shown (thanks to Dan Feigt).

1.6.1 (2010-08-29)
    * No longer ask for INTERNET permission.
    * Re-release without Market copy protection.

1.6.0 (2010-05-22)
    * Retired our custom crash reporting in favor of Google's new
      built-in reporting facility (available starting with Froyo).
    * Support installation on SD card.
    * Added support for a number broadcasts new in Android 2.2.

1.5.7 (2010-05-11)
    * Fixed a stupid bug introduced in the last commit that broke
      orientation change and potentially caused crashes.

1.5.6 (2010-05-04)
    * Work around an Android bug that caused Autostarts to crash when
      processing certain packages that are advertised as being installed,
      but really are broken.

1.5.5 (2010-03-26)
    * Included higher resolution icons for HDPI screens, looks nicer now.
    * Automated exception-reporting functionality.
    * Very slightly improved progressbar behavior during orientation
      change.

1.5.3 (2010-02-23)
    * Show a warning before disabling Google Talk with respect to Market
      downloads.
    * Fixed display of component labels (a regression introduced in the
      1.5.0 backend refactor).
    * Improved way of using the root access; should work on more devices
      now, including the Archos devices and the Sholes Droid Mod.

1.5.0 (2010-02-10)
    * Major rewrite of how we retrieve package information. We no longer
      need to keep track of disabled components ourselves, and an uninstall
      of Autostarts no longer is an issue. The new backend also makes
      it possible for us to show additional events that are not in our
      database. Last but not least we can now show components that are
      disabled by default, and make a clean distinction between that
      initial state and changes by the user.
    * Compiled against 2.1 SDK.
    * Included pretty names and descriptions for a large number of new
      events.

1.2.2 (2010-01-31)
    * Added German translation (does not include event texts).
    * Added support for two new events (SECRET_CODE, SPN_STRINGS_UPDATED).
    * Improved handling of certain events (like PACKAGE_INSTALLED and
      friends) that previously didn't properly show up in many cases.
      There is still some work to do here.
    * On first use and on the help screen we now show information about
      how to workaround the freeze bug in the Superuser Whitelist app.

1.2.1 (2009-10-29)
    * "Eclair-ready" (compiled against 2.0).
    * Support all screen sizes.
    * Support various new events introduced in 1.6 and 2.0.

1.2.0 (2009-10-17)
    * Fixed a pretty serious crash on almost every orientation change.
    * Added option to only show disabled components.

1.1.9 (2009-10-05)
    * Warn the user more clearly about the dangers of uninstalling the
      app while components are still disabled.
    * Support orientation change.
    * Minor architecture improvements under the hood, preparing for
      bigger things to come.

1.1.4 (2009-09-22)
    * Support missing camera.NEW_PICTURE intent.
    * Improved logging when an error occurs during component state change,
      to allow investigating problems.
    * "Donut-ready" (compiled against 1.6).

    * Fixed exception when trying to disable on some non-rooted devices.
    * Fixed rare exception during system configuration change.
    * Fixed apostrophe escaping in various texts, the help screen.

1.1.2 (2009-07-22)
    * Support missing CONNECTIVITY_ACTION intent.

1.1.1 (2009-07-14)
    * Slightly improved some event descriptions.

1.1.0 (2009-07-12)
    * Allow root users to disable components (and enable them again).
    * Added support for the PHONE_STATE action, which we previously missed.

1.0.1 (2009-07-05)
    * Menu option to reload the list.
    * Menu option to expand or collapse all groups in one go.
