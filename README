Why the native code?
====================

We had hoped it would solve the su-hang issue, but it unfortunately 
didn't. Note though that it had at least *some* effect on the Superuser
Whitelist Application: The su request, when the native lib was used,
showed as the callee app:

     /system/bin/sh -c su -c "sh /data/.../pm-call.sh"

Without the native library, using Runtime.exec, our namespace was instead
shown as the callee:

    com.elsdoerfer.android.autostarts

Not sure as to the significance of this.


Compiling the native code
=========================

Create a symlink to "{$project}/jni" in both ``${ndk}/sources`` and
``${ndk}/apps`` named "autostarts", and run "make APP=autostarts"
from within "${ndk}".
