"<b>How does it work?</b>\n"
"\n"
"Android allows applications to register for a variety of events supported"
" by the system, to be started whenever such an event triggers.\n"
"\n"
"This allows applications to do important work in the background, but may "
"sometimes also slow down the system.\n"
"\n"
"Autostarts helps you keep control over your phone by letting you know "
"what goes on behind your back. \n"
"\n"
"<b>Can I remove an application from a particular event?</b>\n"
"\n"
"Yes, but due to Android API limitations, it only works on rooted devices."
" <b>Please be careful when disabling stuff.</b> In particular note that "
"the component in question may be responsible for other parts of the "
"application's functionality than just the given event. As a result, you "
"may experience unintended side effects. For the most part though, you can"
" just give things a try, and enable the component again should the "
"application break. \n"
"\n"
"<b>When I activate the show changed only filter, why do I see stuff that "
"I never actually modified?</b>\n"
"\n"
"Whether a component has changed (and thus displayed in bold) is "
"determined by looking at it's default state versus it's current state. It"
" is possible for a component to be disabled <i>by default</i> after "
"installation, but being activiated by the application itself once needed "
"(for example after you use a specific feature or enable a setting the "
"application). \n"
"\n"
"<b>Is it possible to know what a particular application does on a "
"particular event?</b>\n"
"\n"
"No, not per se. However, if you select an entry, you will be able to see "
"what the name of the <i>component</i> is that handles the event. "
"Sometimes, the name gives you a hint. For example, an "
"<i>AlarmInitReceiver</i> would likely initialize the alarms or "
"notification that you have enabled in the application. Don't be surprised"
" then if this application's alarms stop working if you disable the "
"component. \n"
"\n"
"<b>I've disabled a component, but it seems to have it self enabled again "
"after a while?</b>\n"
"\n"
"Yes, applications may enable or disable their own components. Some do "
"this depending on settings, or what features are enabled. Unfortunately, "
"there is no workaround for this. \n"
"\n"
"<b>My market downloads stopped working.</b>\n"
"\n"
"This is usually not the fault of <i>Autotstarts</i>, don't get ideas. "
"However, there is one issue you might have run into. If you thought you "
"weren't using Google Talk anyway and disabled it's <i>On Boot</i> event, "
"this is likely to be the problem (it also occurs of you shutdown Google "
"Talk using a task manager). Apparently, for some reason, if Google Talk "
"is not running, market downloads do not work."
