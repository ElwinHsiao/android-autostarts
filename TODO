Support grouping by application.

Currently, we don't pay any attention to the fact that a single receiver
may be responsible for multiple events. As a result, disabling a single
component may effect multiple entries. At the very least, the UI should
update accordingly when a component is disabled (striking out multiple
rows).

Add German localization.

Update our custom colors to be stateful.

Use a enabled/disabled receiver to automatically reload if a package
outside of our app is changed.

We could use a custom executable instead of "pm", allowing us to call
setComponentEnabledState with the NO_RESTART flag - currently, the
package is always restarted when we chance something. Code to look at
in frameworks/base:
	cmds/pm/pm
	cmds/pm/src/../Pm.java
	cmds/app_process/*
