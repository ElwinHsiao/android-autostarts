Improve the descriptions of some actions, for example:
  * Widget Update: note that this is also used for manual updates, user
    interaction updates; will likely disable widget changes completely;
	Also note it only run if the widget is in effect.
  * Outgoing Call: Note that this is used for number processing, like
    filters, rewrites etc.
  * Media button: Note that this is the button on the headset.

Support grouping by application.

Currently, we don't pay any attention to the fact that a single receiver
may be responsible for multiple events. As a result, disabling a single
component may effect multiple entries. At the very least, the UI should
update accordingly when a component is disabled (striking out multiple
rows).

Add German localization.

Update our custom colors to be stateful.

Use a enabled/disabled receiver to automatically reload if a package
outside of our app is changed.

We could use a custom executable instead of "pm", allowing us to call
setComponentEnabledState with the NO_RESTART flag - currently, the
package is always restarted when we chance something. Code to look at
in frameworks/base:
	cmds/pm/pm
	cmds/pm/src/../Pm.java
	cmds/app_process/*

Add a "system view" that goes through packages.xml manually and shows
all receivers (or even: all components?), allowing users to disable or
enable them. Explain in help section, why this separate view is necessary:
Because due to API limitations (GET_INTENT_FILTERS not implemented), we
are unable to get information about which intents a disabled comonent would
handle.
